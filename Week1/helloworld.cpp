main() function to run the program

C++ syntax is used to write programs in C++, so C++ compile can transalte to machine readable code.

cout is the stnadard output stream, which is used to output data to the screen.

<< is the stream insertion operator, which is used to insert data into the stream.

endl is the end of line, which is used to end the line.

return 0 means that this function will return 0 to the caller. 

C++ is case sensitive, so the variable name must be written in lower case.
